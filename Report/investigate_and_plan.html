    <h1>Investigation and Plan</h1>

    <p>.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1> Initially, I began investigating 10 possible projects. 
      I have narrowed down the possible projects to three games: Tic tac toe, Blackjack and Snakes and Ladders as all 3 games are simple to recreate and are games that I am familiar with. I researched already existing projects online (listed in references section) and came to the following conclusions:
</p1>
<h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
<p1>  Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where players aim to create a pattern of three X's or O's horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  

<li>Pros of choosing this game include its simplicity and familiarity, making it easy for players to understand and engage with. The game also provides opportunities for strategic play, particularly when playing against a human opponent.</li>
<li>
Cons include the game's potential for becoming repetitive and dull quickly. Additionally, implementing a single-player mode can be challenging, and the game's outcome is deterministic, meaning that once players have learned the optimal strategies, the game will always end in a tie. </li>
</p1>
    
    
<h3>Snakes and Ladders:   </h3>
<p1>  Snakes and Ladders is a multiplayer game played on a numbered grid board featuring snakes and ladders.   

<li>Pros of choosing this game include its popularity and familiarity among players, making it easy to understand and engage with. However, the game's random aspect can add an element of chance, making it exciting and unpredictable. </li>
<li>Cons include the difficulty of programming the board and implementing multiplayer functionality. The game can also become repetitive after multiple plays, potentially reducing its long-term appeal.  </li>
</p1>


  
<H3>Blackjack</H3>
<p4>
  Blackjack is a card game played with one or more decks of standard playing cards. The goal is to beat the dealer by having a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. 
</p4>
</p5>
  The game can be programmed by creating a deck of cards, shuffling the deck, dealing cards to the player and dealer, and implementing the game's rules for hitting and standing.
</p5>
  <li>It includes many inputs such as the ability to hit or stand and changing parameters 
</li>
<li>It is straightforward to code as it is not necessary to generate any boards
</li>
<li>
Includes a random aspect to the game 
</li>
<li>
It is possible to make multiple game modes such as single player, multiplayer and simulation play (Lucia's Simulation)
</li>
<H3>Chosen project: Blackjack</H3>
<p6> After carefully reviewing all the available games and evaluating the mechanics required to implement them, I have selected blackjack as the game that best satisfies the project brief's requirements.</p6>

     <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Provide clear and concise answers to important questions related to the game's mechanics, such as whether the number 21 matters in blackjack or if changing the parameters affects the percentage win rates. This will help users understand the game's performance and increase their chances of winning.
