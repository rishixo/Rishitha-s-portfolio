   <h1>      Evaluation       </h1>

    

    <h3></h3>
    <p1> Overall, I have achieved my goal of developing a fully functional blackjack model that meets all the basic and advanced requirements and the objectives outlined in the plan section. I am confident of the successful completion of the project, as it provides an enjoyable and engaging game experience for the user.

    <td>I have strived to ensure that my code is clean, organized, and easy to read, with appropriate comments to explain complex code sections. I have also rigorously tested the game to eliminate errors and ensure that it runs smoothly, allowing users to play to completion without any issues.  </td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>To ensure that user inputs are valid and appropriate, I have implemented a range of validation checks, such as checking that the user enters a valid bet amount, that they don't bet more than they have, and that their decisions during the game are valid. If an input is found to be invalid, appropriate feedback is given to the user to help them correct the error.

    <td>The statistical analysis of the game is an integral part of the game, and I have taken steps to ensure that it is accurate and runs smoothly. The game uses data stored in a CSV file to calculate key statistics, such as the percentage of wins and the amount of money won or lost by the user. The calculations are performed efficiently and accurately, enabling users to gain valuable insights into their performance. 3 different types of graphs were also produced. 
     </td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>I Finally, I have implemented a betting system that enables users to place bets on each round, adding an element of excitement and risk to the game. The user's money is updated after each round based on the outcome of the game, with winnings added or losses subtracted from their total. This system adds an extra layer of engagement to the game and encourages users to play more strategically.</td>

    <td>I have provided clear and concise answers to common questions related to the game's mechanics, such as the importance of the number 21 in blackjack and how changes to game parameters affect the win rates. By providing this information upfront, users are better equipped to understand the game and increase their chances of winning.
