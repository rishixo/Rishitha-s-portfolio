       <h3> Extent of Testing: </h3>
        <p1> <li>Throughout the development of the software model, white box and unit tests were regularly conducted.</li>
          <li>After implementing each new function, unit tests were performed using equivalence partitions and, more importantly, boundary values.</li>
         <li> Given the numerous comparative operators in blackjack, testing was essential to ensure the game operated smoothly, and the correct outputs were displayed and analyzed.</li> </p1>
        
        <h4>Problem encountered:</h4>
      <p1><li>Early in the project, during white box testing, an issue was discovered where players could place a bet of 1001 from a bank of 1000.</li> 
        <li>This occurred because incorrect inputs were only identified if the input was "greater than" 1001, allowing 1001 to be accepted.</li> 
        <li>The problem was resolved by using the operator "greater than or equal to."</li> 
        <li>Due to the numerous comparative operations in blackjack, testing was performed on every function before proceeding to the next one.</li> </p1>
